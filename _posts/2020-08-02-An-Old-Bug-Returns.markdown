# Updates
Thanks to Github user aarondwolf and Fernando Rios-Avila an issue that I thought was previously resolved resurfaced and was brought back to my attention.  The issue at hand is the URL for ColorBrewer.  I thought I had previously adjusted the URL to use HTTPS, but they both pointed out the error to me and it should now be fixed.
